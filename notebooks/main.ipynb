    "# Neural Numpy\n",
    "This notebook will go through using the neural numpy module we have developed, found in ../src/neural_numpy. To start off, this project is managed using the awesome package manager [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Firstly, ensure that you have installed uv and run `uv sync` to create the venv. After this, select the venv as your kernel in the jupyter notebook. This should now allow you to start importing the libraries needed, as well as the neural-numpy module.\n",

    "## The network config\n",
    "The network has a top level classed creatively called `network`. A network consists of layers, either dense or activation layers, and it handles orchestrating the layers, such as when running forward, backpropagating or training the network. This network can be built manually, or alternatively using the builder class, which is the preferred method. The builder class takes in a config, and builds a network using the parameters given in the config. For the purpose of this project we have mostly used wandb for logging, and therefore a wandb config dictionary can be passed to the builder (However, a method for normal python parameters also exists)"
